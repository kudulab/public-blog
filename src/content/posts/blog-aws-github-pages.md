This is a self-referential post about deploying a personal blog on github pages.
It describes how [kudulab.io](https://kudulab.io) is deployed, starting from scratch, ending with fully-working website deployed using best practices.

All of the supporting code is hosted on [github](https://github.com/kudulab/public-blog), just like all the open source tools used.

### Audience

This post will be most useful to someone building a personal website with similar [technologies](#choosing-the-right-technologies).
You may still find some pieces useful if you

  * want to deploy a static site to [github pages](https://pages.github.com/)
  * are making first steps with [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
  * are learning to use the [AWS Route 53 DNS](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) via terraform AWS provider

## The requirement

We are faced with the following requirement:

  * Build a website where content (posts and static pages) can be managed with markdown.
  * Content should be versioned in git, not served from database. `git push` should be sufficient to make modifications to the website. (aka *push to deploy*)
  * Allow the blog visitors to place comments under posts
  * Add web traffic monitoring
  * Site should be public, hosted on custom domain
  * Serve the site only over `https`
  * The deployment must be fully automated.
  * All operations, infrastructure and development environment must be declared and versioned in code.
  * Keep the hosting costs low

### Choosing the right technologies

There are plenty of available solutions to meet above requirement. This is just one combination which we found to be acceptable. The solution goes like this:

  * We use **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)** - a static site generator to generate a [static page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page).
  * The static web page is hosted by **[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)**. A personal blog's traffic should be well within the [github pages limits](https://help.github.com/en/articles/what-is-github-pages#usage-limits). Github pages [supports custom domains](https://help.github.com/en/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages) and generating https certificates with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
  * Since static pages cannot have dynamic content served by the same host, we need an external solution - we found **[Disqus](https://disqus.com/)** offers a free plan for personal usage. It is also well [integrated with hugo](https://gohugo.io/content-management/comments/#add-disqus).
  * For web traffic monitoring we use **[google analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/)**. Which is also well [integrated with hugo](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/)
  * To setup custom domain and manage the DNS records **as code**, we use **[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)** and **[AWS Route 53 DNS](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)**
  * To define **operations as code** we use bash scripts
  * To define a sufficient **execution environment** of each operation **as code** we use **[Dojo](https://github.com/ai-traders/dojo)** together with [terraform-dojo](https://github.com/kudulab/docker-terraform-dojo) docker image and [hugo-dojo](https://github.com/kudulab/docker-hugo-dojo) docker image.
  * To automate and visualize the lifecycle of the website, we execute them on **[GoCD](https://www.gocd.org/)** pipelines.
  * And finally to define the GoCD **pipelines as code** we use the **[YAML configuration plugin](https://github.com/tomzo/gocd-yaml-config-plugin)**

# Walthrough the work

Now once we know all the components needed to build the website deployment, we can plan the work and get busy.
At the high level we must do all of these tasks:

1. Build a hugo website up to the point of generating a static site.
1. Setup deployment of static site to github pages. So that it is hosted at `kudulab.github.io`.
1. Buy the domain, setup DNS zone and records, so that `kudulab.io` resolves worldwide.
1. Configure github pages to generate SSL certificate for `kudulab.io` and enforce https.
1. Configure Disqus comment section.
1. Configure google analytics.

## Building website with hugo

One of the benefits of hugo is a rich documentation, we can just follow the [quickstart](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) to get a minimal working website.

### Setup hugo

You can follow the [official guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-1-install-hugo) and install hugo on your workstation and all the CI-agents.

However, we recommend a different approach - use docker and [Dojo](https://github.com/ai-traders/dojo) to pull a suitable docker image just before hugo is needed. Although Dojo is a topic for another post, the two biggest benefits are

   * you don't need to install hugo on your host and all CI-agents, but rather install docker and [Dojo](https://github.com/ai-traders/dojo) just once for all the current and future projects you may be responsible for.
   * the website project we are building now will have a **version-controlled reference** to an exact hugo environment which is required. So even if we rerun a task a year from now, we are guaranteed that the same tools are used when we first got it working.

With dojo setup becomes very simple because we have already published a functional [hugo-dojo](https://github.com/kudulab/docker-hugo-dojo) docker image.
At the root of our website project run
```bash
mkdir src
cd src
```
Then create a `Dojofile`:
```
DOJO_DOCKER_IMAGE="kudulab/hugo-dojo:1.0.0"
DOJO_DOCKER_OPTIONS="-p 1313:1313"
```
And run `dojo`.
This will pull the image and enter into docker container with hugo installed and the `src` directory mounted into current directory `/dojo/work`. You should see output like this and then interactive shell prompt:
```console
tomzo@073c1c477b1f:~/code/public-blog2/src$ dojo
2019/04/23 19:00:00 [ 1]  INFO: (main.main) Dojo version 0.3.1

23-04-2019 19:00:01 Dojo entrypoint info: dojo init finished (interactive shell)
dojo@864baf626aa5(hugodojo):/dojo/work$
```

### Create new site

Either way, once we have `hugo` available, we can generate an empty site structure.
From `src` run:
```bash
hugo new site --force .
```
(force is needed to ignore the existing `Dojofile` file)

Then we need to choose and add the [theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/). If you want to manage the theme as git submodule, run this from the root of the project (not from the docker container):

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder.git src/themes/hugo-coder
```

Then configure hugo to use a theme, in `config.toml` add the name of the theme:
```toml
theme = 'hugo-coder'
```

We chose [hugo-coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) theme since it is blog-ish and nice enough. Although particularly for this theme we needed much longer configuration to start from, available on the [wiki](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/wiki/Configurations#complete-example).

By now you should be able to see a live preview of the site, from the dojo docker container run:
```
hugo server -D --bind 0.0.0.0 --baseURL http://localhost:1313
```
Then open http://localhost:1313 in your browser.

Since live preview is an operation we will often execute, we might as well script it.
Let's start `./tasks` bash file with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

command="$1"
case "${command}" in
  live_preview)
      cd src
      dojo "hugo server -D --bind 0.0.0.0 --baseURL http://localhost:1313"
      ;;
  *)
      echo "Invalid command: '${command}'"
      exit 1
      ;;
esac
```

Now we at the root of our project, we can run `./tasks live_preview` and open http://localhost:1313 in the browser to work on the page content.

### Generating static site

Live preview is nice for development, but our website has to be compiled into a static website before deployment.
So for a more accurate preview we should setup a similar hosting environment.
Let's generate the static page:
```bash
hugo --baseUrl=http://localhost:8088
```
This will produce `public` directory (in our project structure that is `src/public`). By now it is nice to add it to `.gitignore`.

We can create a minimal hosting environment using docker and [Apache image](https://docs.docker.com/samples/library/httpd/), from the root of the project run:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8088:80 --name www-host -v "${PWD}/src/public":/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ httpd:2.4.29-alpine
```
In the browser http://localhost:8088 should return the same page which live preview did.

We can script generating the site and creating the demo host, in our `./tasks` file add:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

command="$1"
case "${command}" in
  # [...]
  demo_host)
      docker run -d -p 8088:80 --name www-host\
        -v "${PWD}/src/public":/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/\
        httpd:2.4.29-alpine
      ;;
  cleanup)
      docker stop www-host; docker rm www-host
      ;;
  generate)
      if [[ -z "${KUDU_ENVIRONMENT}" ]]; then
        echo "KUDU_ENVIRONMENT is not set"
        exit 1
      fi
      # baseUrl in static page for production is different than for testing
      if [[ "${KUDU_ENVIRONMENT}" == "testing" ]]; then
        base_url="//localhost:8088/"
      elif [[ "${KUDU_ENVIRONMENT}" == "production" ]]; then
        base_url="https://kudulab.github.io/"
      else
        echo "Unsupported KUDU_ENVIRONMENT=${KUDU_ENVIRONMENT}, exit 1"
        exit 1
      fi
      cd src
      rm -rf public/*
      dojo "hugo --baseUrl=${base_url}"
      ;;
  *)
      echo "Invalid command: '${command}'"
      exit 1
      ;;
esac
```

To play nice, we should automate the process of testing if hosted website actually has the expected content.
In a larger website project we could implement stronger tests with selenium or alike framework.
For the purposes of this blog, we perform a simple smoke test, using curl and checking for the unique pieces of the page.
We use bats to implement the simple test:

`test/integration/bats/test.bats`
```bash
load '/opt/bats-support/load.bash'
load '/opt/bats-assert/load.bash'

@test "home page is available" {
  run /bin/bash -c "curl -i -L localhost:8088"
  assert_output --partial "200 OK"
  assert_output --partial "<title>KuduLab</title>"
  assert_output --partial "Home"
  assert_output --partial "Projects"
  assert_output --partial "About"
  assert_equal "$status" 0
}
```
The test can be scripted in `./tasks`, add a test task:
```bash
  test)
      bats "$(pwd)/test/integration/bats"
      ;;
```

Then we can start running generate and test on a GoCD pipeline to make sure it still works while we introduce changes.
At the root of our project create `pipeline.gocd.yaml`
```yaml
format_version: 4
pipelines:
  public-blog:
    group: www
    label_template: "${git[:8]}"
    materials:
      git:
        type: configrepo
    stages:
      - test:
          clean_workspace: true
          environment_variables:
            KUDU_ENVIRONMENT: testing
          jobs:
            test:
              # depending on your setup, either change the elastic_profile_id or use resources
              elastic_profile_id: w.c1.m1024.e5
              tasks:
                - exec:
                    command: /bin/bash
                    arguments:
                      - -c
                      - ./tasks generate
                - exec:
                    command: /bin/bash
                    arguments:
                      - -c
                      - ./tasks demo_host
                - exec:
                    command: /bin/bash
                    arguments:
                      - -c
                      - ./tasks test
                - exec:
                    run_if: any
                    command: /bin/bash
                    arguments:
                      - -c
                      - ./tasks cleanup
```

By now we should have commited all files and pushed to git server.
Then to finish the pipeline setup, we should add configuration repository to the GoCD server using the [documented steps](https://docs.gocd.org/current/advanced_usage/pipelines_as_code.html#storing-pipeline-configuration-in-json).

## Deployment to github pages

Github pages deployments are very simple - we just need to commit and push our static site to a repository with a [magic name](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#github-user-or-organization-pages).
We are building a personal blog, initially to be hosted at `kudulab.github.io`, therefore we must create a github repository named `kudulab.github.io`.
We already have a task to generate the production site, which produces static site in `src/public`.
```bash
KUDU_ENVIRONMENT=production ./tasks generate
```
So in order to deploy it, we only need to commit all the generated content into `kudulab.github.io` repository and push it to github, which will trigger github hosting to update content on `https://kudulab.github.io`.
We can automate this operation in the `./tasks` script:

```bash
publish)
    git_ref=$(git log -1 --pretty='format:%H')
    git clone git@github.com:kudulab/kudulab.github.io.git kudulab.github.io
    cd kudulab.github.io
    for a_file in *; do
      rm -rf "${a_file}"
    done
    cp -r ../src/public/* .
    git add .
    git commit -m "generated from git ref: ${git_ref}" || true
    git push
    ;;
```

Therefore the entire generate and publish procedure can be executed with
```bash
KUDU_ENVIRONMENT=production ./tasks generate
./tasks publish
```

Above 2 steps can be added as a stage in the GoCD pipeline:
```yaml
- publish:
    clean_workspace: true
    environment_variables:
      KUDU_ENVIRONMENT: production
    jobs:
      publish:
        elastic_profile_id: w.c1.m1024.e5
        tasks:
          - exec:
              command: /bin/bash
              arguments:
                - -c
                - ./tasks generate
          - exec:
              command: /bin/bash
              arguments:
                - -c
                - ./tasks publish
```

#### Versioning and releases

It is technically possible to deploy site on each commit. However we prefer to publish only such content, which was previously released with changes documented in the changelog. For that purpose, we have published [releaser](https://github.com/kudulab/releaser) - a set of common bash functions to help with managing the changelog and git releases.
To start using the releaser, at the top of `./tasks` file add:
```bash
RELEASER_VERSION="2.1.0"
RELEASER_FILE="ops/releaser-${RELEASER_VERSION}"

mkdir -p ops
if [[ ! -f $RELEASER_FILE ]];then
  wget --quiet -O $RELEASER_FILE https://github.com/kudulab/releaser/releases/download/${RELEASER_VERSION}/releaser
fi
source $RELEASER_FILE
```

There are 2 useful operations we can add in `./tasks`
```bash
set_version)
    releaser::bump_changelog_version "$2" "$3"
    ;;
release)
    releaser::verify_release_ready
    releaser::git_tag_from_changelog
    ;;
```
We can use `./tasks set_version 0.1.0` to manage the version and release date the top of the changelog and `./tasks release` to add git tag to the repository with the version from top of the changelog.

To cut our first release, we should initialize a changelog.
```
touch CHANGELOG.md
./tasks set_version 0.1.0
```
This should produce output like:
```
24-04-2019 09:43:01 RELEASER info: New version will be: 0.1.0
24-04-2019 09:43:01 RELEASER info: Bumped to 0.1.0 in CHANGELOG.md
```

We should now document changes we have made in the project since last release, in case of our first release, the changelog could look like this:
```md
### 0.1.0 (2019-Apr-15)

Initial release, empty site deployed to kudulab.github.io
```

The last step, before deployment would be to add automated code releases to the GoCD pipeline. It is enough to add `./tasks release` in `release` stage.
The pipeline YAML should look like this by now:
```yaml
format_version: 4
pipelines:
  public-blog:
    group: www
    label_template: "${git[:8]}"
    materials:
      git:
        type: configrepo
    stages:
      - test:
          clean_workspace: true
          environment_variables:
            KUDU_ENVIRONMENT: testing
          jobs:
            test:
              elastic_profile_id: w.c1.m1024.e5
              tasks:
                - exec:
                    command: /bin/bash
                    arguments:
                      - -c
                      - ./tasks generate
                - exec:
                    command: /bin/bash
                    arguments:
                      - -c
                      - ./tasks demo_host
                - exec:
                    command: /bin/bash
                    arguments:
                      - -c
                      - ./tasks test
                - exec:
                    run_if: any
                    command: /bin/bash
                    arguments:
                      - -c
                      - ./tasks cleanup
      - release:
          clean_workspace: true
          jobs:
            code:
              elastic_profile_id: w.c1.m1024.e5
              tasks:
                - exec:
                    command: /bin/bash
                    arguments:
                      - -c
                      - ./tasks release
      - publish:
          clean_workspace: true
          environment_variables:
            KUDU_ENVIRONMENT: production
          jobs:
            publish:
              elastic_profile_id: w.c1.m1024.e5
              tasks:
                - exec:
                    command: /bin/bash
                    arguments:
                      - -c
                      - ./tasks generate
                - exec:
                    command: /bin/bash
                    arguments:
                      - -c
                      - ./tasks publish
```

Now we can commit and push, then watch the pipeline running the release and deployment.
When we visit `kudulab.github.io` the page should be there.

## Domain and DNS setup

Often when choosing domain name registrar we also get access to a DNS server.
For our purposes, it is important that we can access DNS as a service over HTTP API and preferably there is a terraform provider for it.
Unoriginally, we went with AWS Route 53, which is well documented and supported by the [terraform AWS provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/route53_record.html).

### Install terraform

You can install terraform and AWS plugin yourself or leverage [Dojo](https://github.com/ai-traders/dojo) and the [terraform-dojo](https://github.com/kudulab/docker-terraform-dojo) docker image:

We will manage infrastructure (the DNS records) from `terraform` directory:
```bash
mkdir -p terraform
```
To declare which [terraform-dojo](https://github.com/kudulab/docker-terraform-dojo) docker image to use, we create a `Dojofile`
```
DOJO_DOCKER_IMAGE="kudulab/terraform-dojo:1.0.2"
```
Then run `dojo` to enter a container with terraform and several plugins installed.

### Provision DNS

We start with buying the domain using AWS management console. The process is quite straightforward. You need an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/account/), then login to the management console, go to [route53](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home#DomainListing:) and click on big blue button "Register Domain".

Once you are done with purchasing the domain, there will be a DNS zone created already, which you can see in [Hosted zones](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home#hosted-zones:). Notice the Hosted Zone ID, which is visible on the screenshot below:

![aws zone screenshot](/images/aws_dns_zone.png)

[Github pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain) documentation is very helpful in guiding us through the process of DNS setup. Since we are building a website on an apex domain, we [cannot simply create a CNAME](https://www.isc.org/blogs/cname-at-the-apex-of-a-zone/) record from `kudulab.io` to `kudulab.github.io`.
Instead we will provision DNS `A` records so that `kudulab.io` resolves into IPs of github pages load balancer. These are specified in the [github pages documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain#configuring-a-records-with-your-dns-provider).

We declare the desired infrastructure in `dns.tf` terraform file:
```
# root zone was created externally,
# we don't manage the zone in infra of the blog
# because zone is shared by many services
variable "root_zone_id" {
  default = "Z1B6OG086ITGV2"
}

# Configure the AWS Provider
provider "aws" {
  # You can provide your credentials via
  # the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, environment variables
  region     = "us-east-1"
}

A typical workflow with terraform is

1. [terraform init](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html) to perform initialization in current directory and optional [backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html#backend-initialization)
1. [terraform plan](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html) which compares current infrastructure state to the desired one, which we defined in `*.tf` files. It can output a plan file with actions to take.
1. [terraform apply](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html) which if used with a plan file, will execute previously planned actions.

So in the simplest form, to create our infrastructure we would run:
```
terraform init
terraform plan -out="deployment.tfplan"
terraform apply deployment.tfplan
```

However, particularly in our infrastructure we use [consul as backend for terraform state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/consul.html) store and we use [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) to provide AWS authentication credentials. With GoCD usage of vault is not necessary, you could alternatively use a secure environment variables to [encrypt](https://api.gocd.org/current/#encrypt-a-plain-text-value) the `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and then place the value in gocd yaml.
To encrypt the secret, you can use curl:
```
curl 'https://ci.example.com/go/api/admin/encrypt' \
  -u 'username:password' \
  -H 'Accept: application/vnd.go.cd.v1+json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -X POST -d '{
    "value": "<your secret access key>"
  }'
```
The server will respond with
```
{
  "_links" : {
    "doc" : {
      "href" : "https://api.gocd.org/#encryption"
    },
    "self" : {
      "href" : "https://ci.example.com/go/api/admin/encrypt"
    }
  },
  "encrypted_value" : "AES:GUkf7B+eai1yfcpOWfdtJQ==:2cOCnJtg2HD4eJOrVGXHEN6c/q8RYZyfebVLDCbP+JY="
}
```
Then in GoCD yaml add the `encrypted_value` to `secure_variables` at stage or job level:
```yaml
secure_variables:
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: "AES:GUkf7B+eai1yfcpOWfdtJQ==:2cOCnJtg2HD4eJOrVGXHEN6c/q8RYZyfebVLDCbP+JY="
```

Converging DNS can be scripted in `./tasks` file with the following snippet:
```bash
function tf_apply {
  operation=$1

  cd terraform/
  terraform init -backend-config path=terraform/kudu-www
  if [[ "${operation}" == "apply" ]]; then
    terraform plan -out="kudu_deployment.tfplan"
  elif [[ "${operation}" == "destroy" ]]; then
    terraform plan -out="kudu_deployment.tfplan" -destroy
  fi
  terraform apply kudu_deployment.tfplan
}

command="$1"
case "${command}" in
  _set_dns)
      tf_apply "apply"
      ;;
  set_dns)
      # AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY from vault
      export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(read_from_vault_or_die "aws" "access_key_id")
      export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(read_from_vault_or_die "aws" "secret_access_key")
      dojo -c terraform/Dojofile "./tasks _set_dns"
      ;;
# [...]
esac
```
The user identified with `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` must have sufficient permissions to change DNS resources in AWS. For example you can use the [AWS managed policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html) `AmazonRoute53FullAccess`.

With such setup, we can idempotently provision DNS records with `./tasks set_dns`.
The last point would be to setup this step on a GoCD pipeline. We can add one more stage in `pipeline.gocd.yaml`:
```yaml
- dns:
    clean_workspace: true
    environment_variables:
      KUDU_ENVIRONMENT: production
    secure_variables:
      VAULT_TOKEN: "AES:bYwjpIz02AtPshnMBaBdnA==:BwACwa5fWInrHU2xXfyJlM2qFKk2lE9g+d5gGAFTl3sjg/sLdJqDfKW3Qki4vwfH"
    jobs:
      provision:
        elastic_profile_id: w.c1.m1024.e5
        tasks:
          - exec:
              command: /bin/bash
              arguments:
                - -c
                - ./tasks set_dns
```

After `dns` stage completes, we may need to wait a moment before DNS records propagate around the world, a nice tool to watch the progress is available at https://dnschecker.org

#### Configure custom domain on github pages

Several changes are required in our `tasks` script to make github pages serve page from `https://kudulab.io` rather than `https://kudulab.github.io`.

1. We need to [update `baseUrl`](https://github.com/kudulab/public-blog/commit/65083c92e099f607aaa89f8269f2d380851e488e) when generating the production static site.
1. We need to [commit `CNAME`](https://github.com/kudulab/public-blog/commit/ac3be0b94df0074abf492fb439b0efe792cccb9b) at the root of github pages repository with our domain name - `kudulab.io`. This will configure github load balancer to serve a page for `kudulab.io` and it will trigger re-generation of the SSL certificate for `kudulab.io`.
1. To ensure that `https` is always used, we need to [edit settings on github](https://help.github.com/en/articles/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https) and check "Enforce HTTPS".

The `generate` and `publish` tasks should look like this now:
```bash
generate)
    if [[ -z "${KUDU_ENVIRONMENT}" ]]; then
      echo "KUDU_ENVIRONMENT is not set"
      exit 1
    fi
    # baseUrl in static page for production is different than for testing
    if [[ "${KUDU_ENVIRONMENT}" == "testing" ]]; then
      base_url="//localhost:8088/"
    elif [[ "${KUDU_ENVIRONMENT}" == "production" ]]; then
      base_url="https://kudulab.io/"
    else
      echo "Unsupported KUDU_ENVIRONMENT=${KUDU_ENVIRONMENT}, exit 1"
      exit 1
    fi
    cd src
    rm -rf public/*
    dojo "hugo --baseUrl=${base_url}"
    ;;
publish)
    git_ref=$(git log -1 --pretty='format:%H')
    git clone git@github.com:kudulab/kudulab.github.io.git kudulab.github.io
    cd kudulab.github.io
    # remove everything but for .git directory
    for a_file in *; do
      rm -rf "${a_file}"
    done
    cp -r ../src/public/* .
    echo "kudulab.io" > CNAME
    git add .
    git commit -m "generated from git ref: ${git_ref}" || true
    git push
    ;;
```

## Configure Disqus

It is very simple process - setup an account on https://disqus.com/
and configure a new site in the discus admin panel. This will provide you with a site ID.

Then in hugo, we just need to add the ID in `src/config.toml`
```
disqusShortname = "your-id"
```

## Configure google analytics

Also a simple process, you register a site on google, which provides you with an ID.

Then in hugo, we just need to add the ID in `src/config.toml`
```
googleAnalytics = "your-id"
```

## Summary

Starting from nothing, we have built a website with code, infrastructure and operations checked-in the source control.
Now any changes can be introduced to production by git commits and running `git push`.
While it may seem like an overkill to apply all of these efforts for a simple website, we find that this set of practices is very resilient to external changes because we have locked version of practically every dependency of this project. In this repository we have nearly every piece which makes the website work and controls its lifecycle, this makes maintenance straightforward and project easier to share.

Feel free to comment and ask questions, we'll certainly engage with you.
